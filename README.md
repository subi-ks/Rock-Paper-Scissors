# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Welcome to the kids game of rock-paper-and-scissors. This is two-player(You Vs Computer) game and all it requires is luck. No strategy and no cheating :P
Let me laid out the rules for the game:
1. The priority order is: Rock > Scissors, Scissors > Paper, and Paper > Rock.
2. The player gets 1 point for each round if they win.
3. You have an upperhand in choosing the number of rounds for this game. If you wish not to choose then you can let yur opponent to choose the number of rounds. 
4. If both players choose the same element (e.g Paper - Paper) then no points is allocated to the players and is considered as a draw. If any unfortunate case when all rounds is draw then an extra match is conducted untill a player is won.
5. Shout "ROCK PAPER AND SCISSORS" loudly while playing the game to add the fun. 
6. You have yet again an upperhand to either choose a rematch or quit the game.

The rules are simple and easy and nor you are ready to play!
